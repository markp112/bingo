# bingo
A game of bingo to be played between player and the computer. The game will generate between 1 and 6 bingo cards, the player has to mark off the numbers on their cards as they are drawn and complete a full house before all the numbers are drawn. It is up to the player to call bingo, the game will validate the numbers that have been drawn against those marked by the player and determine if these match.

There are two settings -> The number of cards a player can choose between 1 and 6 but for certain displays this is limited to 2 or 4 as the screen size limits the number of cards available.

the player can also choose the difficulty which controls the speed at which numbers are drawn, depending on the number of cards chosen the difficulty can be selected.
